The design of the classes was done jointly with Wyatt focusing on the statements
and declarations while Andrew focused on the expressions. Wyatt implemented the 
classes into ast.h and Andrew compared results from the classes and the sample 
texts to fix bugs in the code. Wyatt modified all of the functions in parser.cc
to create the AST using the classes in ast.h.

The UML diagram has been provided as a .pdf file, but it isn't the most readable
format for it. The .html version has been provided as a more readable format.
