Wyatt Kormick
Group Archaeopteryx

Wyatt changed the kTokenEnumType and scanner to recognize the boolean, True, False, and while keywords. Andrew wrote the test cases for these keywords into scanner_tests.h. Andrew wrote mysample.dsl in FCAL language. The debugging process was done jointly and was mainly focused on fixing the Makefile.
