 Division of Labor
  As a group, the three of us planned how the project would go, and what work
  needed to get done. Also as a group, we started writing, and finished writing
  the router_process() function, with Jon working on it on his own in between.
  Wyatt and Ve worked together to write the uri_entered_cb() and
  create_new_tab_cb() functions. Jon, as the most experienced C programmer,
  wrote the majority of the code of our browser program. Vy and Jon tested the
  program, while Wyatt worked on writing documentation for the project.

 Compiling the program
  To compile the program, run the shell command "make" inside the "src"
  directory. "make all" will also work, and "make clean" will remove any files
  generated by the compilation process.

 Running the program
  After compilation, inputting "./browser" to the shell while inside the "src"
  directory will run the browser program.
