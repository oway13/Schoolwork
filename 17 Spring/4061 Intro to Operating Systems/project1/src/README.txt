At the first few of our group meetings, we all discussed the logical flow of
our project and worked out how the entire program should work as a group.

Jon, as our most experienced C programmer, wrote the majority of our
project. This was mostly done during our group meetings, so the other members
made suggestions, and helped sort out any problems that occurred.

Vy created tests to try to break the program. This improved our confidence in the code and helped to find any errors that there were.

Wyatt provided documentation. This includes some of the comments in the code to increase readability, and this readme file.
