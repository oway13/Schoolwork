To compile the project, in the top level directory of the project, use the 
command "make all".

To run the sender and receiver use the command "./packet_sender #" in one
terminal window and "./packet_receiver #" in another, where # is the number of
packets you want to send and receive.

To run the custom memory manager use "./main_mm", and to use the provided
malloc memory manager, use "./main_malloc".

Jon and Wyatt worked jointly on the packet_sender and packet_receiver. Jon
created the memory manager on his own, and Wyatt joined him to make the
finishing touches on it. Vy helped Jon try to make the memory manager more
efficient. Vy also tested the project, trying to find ways to break the program, 
helping find any errors that there may have been.
