PREPROCESSING(A)
	Let k be the largest element in A
	Let C[0...k] be a new array
	for i = 0 to k  			//O(k)
		C[i] = 0
	for j = 1 to A.length		//O(n)
		C[A[j]] = C[A[j]]+1
	for i = 1 to k				//O(k)
		C[i] = C[i]+C[i-1]
	return C
//Exactly the same as the preprocessing part
//	of COUNTING-SORT
//Returns an array that contains the sum of the count of each
//	element in A from 0 to k

QUERY(A, a, b)
	Let C[] be a new array
	if b > a
		C = Preprocessing(A) 	//O(n+2k)
		return C[b + 1] - C[a+1] //O(1)
//Subtracts the total amount of elements at the lower end
//from the total amount at the upper end to get the amount
//between
