# CSci-4611 Assignment 3:  Earthquake

Drag with mouse to rotate the globe
	If the globe gets vertically inverted, the horizontal 
	rotation gets inverted

My globe normal vectors are for each vertex and are equal to the difference between the vertex and the globe's center at the origin.

My earthquake representation is a red sphere at the earthquake's location. The size of the sphere represents the magnitude of the earthquake. This becomes more apparent later in the simulation when small earthquakes start to be recorded in the data, they become very small spheres.
