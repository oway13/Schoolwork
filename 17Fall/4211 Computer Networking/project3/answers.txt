Part 4:
Latency: The latency to get from host 1 to host 4 should be the sums of the latencies
to get from h1 to h2, from h2 to h3, and from h3 to h4. Our prediction is 140ms because
L1 had an average latency of 80ms, L2 had an average latency of 20ms, and L3 has an
average latency of 40ms.

Throughput: Throughput along a path is limited by the lowest throughput link along
the path. The throughput to get from host 1 to host 4 should be the minimum of the
 throughputs of l1, l2, and l3. Since our minimum was '17.7 Mbits/sec', '20.5 Mbits/sec',
 our prediction is somewhere around '17.5 Mbits/sec', '20.5 Mbits/sec'

 Results:
 Average Latency: 140.976ms
 Throughput: '17.2 Mbits/sec', '20.9 Mbits/sec'

Both of our conditions were correct.
